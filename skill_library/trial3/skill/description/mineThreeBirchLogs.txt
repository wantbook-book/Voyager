async function mineThreeBirchLogs(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 3 birch logs using a wooden axe. First, it checks if the bot has a wooden axe in its inventory. If not, it checks if it has enough oak planks and sticks to craft one. If not, it crafts the required items. Then, it checks if there is a crafting table nearby. If not, it returns. If there is a crafting table, it crafts a wooden axe using the crafting table and the available materials. 

Afterwards, it enters a loop to find and mine 3 birch log blocks. It explores the environment until it finds a birch log block within a certain distance. If it can't find a birch log block, it returns. If it finds a birch log block, it mines it. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that 3 birch logs have been mined.
