async function craftStonePickaxe(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting a stone pickaxe. First, it checks if there are enough cobblestones in the inventory. If not, it mines more cobblestones. Then, it checks if there is a crafting table in the inventory. If not, it explores the environment until it finds a crafting table. If no crafting table is found, it returns. Next, it places the crafting table near the player. Finally, it crafts a stone pickaxe using the cobblestones and the crafting table, and sends a chat message indicating that the stone pickaxe has been crafted.
